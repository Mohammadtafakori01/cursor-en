cursor-en documentation scratchpad
=================================

Use this file for quick jot notes before promoting them into a dedicated guide. Keep entries short and link to stable documentation once drafted.

Working agreements
------------------
- Treat `main` as the source of truth; open pull requests for every change.
- Prefer Markdown in `docs/` for anything longer than a short reminder.
- Note unanswered questions here so they are easy to triage later.

Documentation backlog
---------------------
1. **Workflow tour:** A short walkthrough of how to run through a typical Cursor task.
2. **Templates:** Copy-ready sections for changelogs, release notes, and testing plans.
3. **Decision log:** Record why certain conventions (naming, branching) were chosen.

Review checklist
----------------
- Does the new text explain *why* as well as *what*?
- Are commands copy/paste ready and verified recently?
- Did we include follow-up steps or testing expectations where relevant?

Glossary
--------
- **Cursor task:** Any guided workflow where instructions are carried out inside Cursor.
- **Docs-first:** A mindset where documentation is updated before or alongside code changes.

Next up
-------
Capture concrete processes (e.g., onboarding a collaborator) in `docs/` soon so this scratchpad can stay lean.
